# TyperX

Typerx is a typing speed test app made with the Avalonia UI framework.

## Features

- **30-second typing test**  
  Type as many random words as you can in 30 seconds.
  
- **Real-time feedback**  
  You get feedback for each word you type:
  - **JÃ³!:** The word is right.
  - **Hiba!:** The word is wrong.

- **Results display**  
  At the end, you see:
  - **WPM (words per minute)**
  - **Accuracy percentage**

## How It Works

1. **Start the test:**  
   Click the **start** button to begin.

2. **Type the words:**  
   Type the words shown and press **enter** to check your word.

3. **Timer:**  
   The timer goes down from 30 seconds and updates every 100 milliseconds.

4. **Test completion:**  
   The test ends when:
   - The 30-second timer is finished, or
   - All the words are typed.

5. **Results:**  
   When the test ends, your wpm and accuracy are calculated and shown.

  It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
